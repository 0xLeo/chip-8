# About Chip-8

### What is Chip-8?
Chip-8 is not an actual hardware. It's a a virtual machine that was implemented by a number of computers in the 70s and calculators in the 80s. It was designed for people to program really early home microcomputers. Instead of using actual microprocessor opcodes, it was always designed to be a virtual language and be interpreted at runtime [reference](http://www.emulator101.com/introduction-to-chip-8.html).
